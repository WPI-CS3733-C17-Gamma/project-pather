##### A patient pathfinding application
Developed for Worcester Polytechnic Institute's CS3733 "Software
Engineering" class by Team Gamma.

The objective of this program is to provide pathfinding to healthcare
providers and services at the
[Brigham and Women's Faulkner Hospital](http://www.brighamandwomensfaulkner.org),
although it should ideally be generalizable to any hospital.

### Building from source
To build/run this application, simply execute the provided gradle
script with task `jfxRun`. On Windows, this should simply be `gradlew
jfxRun`, while on OS X or Linux, it should be `./gradlew jfxRun`. This
script should pull in all dependencies, build, and run the
application.
